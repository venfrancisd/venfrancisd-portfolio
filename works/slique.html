							<p>As the lead designer of Slique, a mobile application that connects club and event organizers to DJs and artists, my main goal is to support the MVP release of the app and ensure that users have a seamless experience while using the app. </p>
                            
                            <p>Since the production team is situated here in the Philippines, the marketing team and the founders themselves are the ones who are conducting the research in Singapore.</p>

                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            
                            <p>Slique is a mobile app that enables club owners to book entertainment providers such as DJs and artists, thus addressing staffing challenges in the nightlife industry. To better understand the market and user needs, we conducted research through interviews, surveys, and personal experience. This write-up aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of our research findings, including historical data, user pain points, and core needs.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            
                            <p>Singapore's nightlife industry has been steadily growing over the years. According to a report by KPMG, the industry generated over S$6.7 billion in revenue in 2018, with the number expected to reach S$9.5 billion by 2023. The report further highlights that the growth is attributed to an increasing number of visitors to Singapore, an expanding middle class, and an overall increase in disposable income.</p>
                            
                            <p>However, the industry faces several challenges, including a shortage of skilled workers and high staff turnover rates. A survey conducted by the Singapore Nightlife Business Association revealed that over 60% of clubs struggle to find qualified workers, particularly DJs and bartenders.</p>
                            
                            <strong>Personal Experience</strong>
                            
                            <p>The concept behind Slique stemmed from a personal experience. While enjoying a night out with friends, our founder overheard his friend, a club owner, express frustration over the lack of a last-minute replacement for a missing DJ. This conversation served as the trigger for creating Slique to address staffing challenges in the nightlife industry. Inspired by this encounter, the founder envisioned a simple and efficient Uber-like platform connecting DJs and club owners to book entertainment providers with ease and speed.</p>
                            
                            <p>The founder saw an opportunity to create a platform that would cut out the agent middleman. With the increasing popularity of online marketplaces and the gig economy, the founder saw a clear need for a platform that would allow club owners to search for and book DJs and artists directly, without having to go through a traditional agent or booking service. This would not only save them time and money but also provide them with more control and flexibility over their events.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Research Findings</h2>
                            
                            <strong>Interview result with 8 club owners</strong>
                            
                            <p>We conducted interviews with 8 club owners in Singapore to understand their pain points and needs. The interviews revealed that club owners face difficulties in finding and booking entertainment providers on short notice, leading to a decrease in customer satisfaction and revenue. One club owner shared, "It's frustrating when our regular DJs cancel at the last minute, and we are unable to find a replacement in time. Our customers expect us to provide quality entertainment, and when we fail to deliver, they are less likely to return.”</p>
                            
                            <strong>Survey result with 30 nightclub-goers</strong>
                            
                            <p>We conducted a survey of 30 nightclub-goers in Singapore to understand their experiences and pain points. The respondents includes nightclub-goers across a range of ages, with roughly equal numbers of respondents in three age brackets (under 25, 25-40, and over 40). These respondents are goers from popular nightclubs in Singapore such as Zouk, Ce La Vi, Canvas, Bang Bang, and Attica to name the few.</p>

                            <p>The survey revealed that 70% of respondents had experienced a lack of quality entertainment at a nightclub. When asked about the reasons for this, 40% of respondents cited canceled or no-show DJs as the main reason, while 30% cited a lack of variety in the entertainment provided. The survey also revealed that 80% of respondents would be more likely to visit a nightclub if they knew they could expect quality entertainment.</p>

                                        <strong>Difficulty in finding last-minute replacements</strong>
                                        <p>One of the biggest challenges club owners face is finding reliable and talented entertainment providers, especially on short notice. In the fast-paced and competitive world of nightlife, cancellations and no-shows can result in lost revenue and disappointed customers. Traditional methods of booking entertainment, such as referrals and word of mouth, can be time-consuming and not always reliable.</p>

                                        <p>Another challenge is managing the logistics of scheduling and coordinating with entertainment providers. This can involve multiple phone calls, emails, and negotiations, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming for club owners who are already busy running their businesses.</p>

                                        <strong>Lack of transparency</strong>
                                        <p>Several interviewees cited the lack of transparency in the industry as a significant frustration. This includes unclear pricing structures and hidden fees, which can lead to misunderstandings and disputes.</p>

                                        <p>There is a need to discover and promote local talent in the nightlife industry. Up-and-coming DJs and artists often struggle to break into the scene and gain exposure. They may not have the necessary connections or resources to secure gigs and promote themselves effectively.</p>
